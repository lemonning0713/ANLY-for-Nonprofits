### Goal:
- Does amphibian 1) species composition, 2) abundance of individuals and 3) size distribution of individuals  change with distance from the platform and phase of construction/operation of the natural gas well?

- If there are differences, what is causing them? Environmental changes, natural fluctuations, construction/operation activities?

- Other note: As discussed, we can first work on these amphibian data and then move on to other response variables from other taxonomic groups. We have plant data from plot sampling (similar to the amphibian sampling methods), mammal data from camera trapping (as Tremie talked about a bit yesterday), and also bird data from different sampling methods. 
 
- Finally, here are a couple papers on the occupancy modeling analysis we mentioned yesterday, so you can see how it is being used in ecological studies:
